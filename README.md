# Google Ad Scrape

Checks to see which companies pay for their company name on Google Adwords.

## How It Works

- Uses [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/) to scrape the Fortune 500 website and google search results
- Saves screenshots of the search results for reference

## Why

A lot of companies seem to purchase AdWords for their own company name. I was curious how many do, so I made a scraper to find out.

A lot of consumers will also search for a website instead of typing the url directly, so companies are probably wasting a lot of money on this. But what do I know ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
